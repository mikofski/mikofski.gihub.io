Dear Representative Lee, Senator Harris, and Senator Feinstein, 
I have been shocked by the stories of inhumane treatment of border detainees especially children and mothers. But it's difficult to know what is truly going on. Nevertheless, I believe that the United States should be setting the highest standard for treatment of immigrants, regardless of how they got here, what conditions they endured, and who they are, but especially refugees, children, and women. I am concerned that the United States is committing human rights violations, and that our reputation abroad is being damaged. 
Can you please ask congress and the president to explain what is going on in these camps, and ascertain whether or not immigrants basic human rights are being violated? I believe we deserve to know, and that we should end inhumane practices, especially against women and children immediately. 
Thank you, 
Mark Mikofski
